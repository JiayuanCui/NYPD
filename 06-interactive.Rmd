# Interactive component

To get a more accurate sense of distribution of crime types over different boroughs, and to compare such distribution over different boroughs, this interactive barchart is created.

The x axis represents the total number of crime cases in 2021 and y axis represents the category.

If you want figures on the bars click show figure, otherwise click hide figure. Note that please first choose if you want figure or not, then choose the borough, otherwise you may forget which borough you have just chosen. The default plot is for Brooklyn.

From test.html, you can see that I read data from a cleaned version in my own repo:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ted5834314/NYC_Data/main/crimetype.csv

Which is simply the crime counts for different categories in different boroughs.
