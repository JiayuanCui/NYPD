# Interactive component

To get a more accurate sense of distribution of crime types over different boroughs, and to compare such distribution over different boroughs, this interactive barchart is created. If you want figures on the bars click show figure, otherwise click hide figure. Note that please first choose if you want figure or not, then choose the borough, otherwise you may forget which borough you have just chosen. The default plot is for Brooklyn
