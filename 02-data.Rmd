# Data sources



Jiayuan is mainly responsible for section 3 and 5

Yujie is mainly responsible for section 1 2 and 7

Xuchen is mainly responsible for section 4 and 6

Our group downloaded NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date) dataset provided by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), containing the data for all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to NYPD for all complete quarters so far this year (2021). 

Crime data for city of NYC available from NYC Open Data at: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 

There are total of 324k rows and 36 columns in this dataset. The 36 variables ranges from exact locations of the occurrences to exact time of the occurrences. Details for key attributes are listed below:



BORO_NM	- The name of the borough in which the incident occurred

CMPLNT_FR_DT - Exact date of occurrence for the reported event

CMPLNT_FR_TM - Exact time of occurrence for the reported event

OFNS_DESC	- Description of offense corresponding with key code

LONGITUDE - longitude of the crime case

LATITUDE - latitude of the crime case


As we checked the data types, we found the there are only 3 types of the variables: character, number, and integer. In order to better analyze the crimes, we converted the character type of data time to date type. To make offense types more readable and understandable, we categorized the OFNS_DESC to more generalized level so that our graphs would provide a better visualization.

In our project, since we are analyzing the most recent crimes in New York, we subset data into more manageable smaller dataset with observations started from Jan 1, 2021 instead of the complete dataset. 

Data for November and December are missing since they have not been published. Data for October is partial by the same reason. So in some plots we may only include the first 9 months

Another problem with the dataset is there are a number of missing values for part of the variables, this would be discussed in more details in section 4.
