# Data sources

Oour group downloaded NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date) dataset provided by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), containing the data for all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to NYPD for all complete quarters so far this year (2021). 
Crime data for city of NYC available from NYC Open Data at: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 

There are total of 324k rows and 36 columns in this dataset. The 36 variables ranges from exact locations of the occurrences to exact time of the occurrences. 

In our project, since we are analyzing the most recent crimes in New York, we subset data into more manageable smaller dataset with observations started from Jan 1, 2021 instead of the complete dataset. 

As we checked the data types, we found the there are only 3 types of the variables: character, number, and integer. In order to better analyze the crimes, we converted the character type of data time to date type.

Another problem with the dataset is there are a number of missing values for part of the variables, such as BORO_NM (The name of the borough in which the incident occurred). Thus, in the following work, we will only extract variables with complete information and draw different plots to identity the questions below:

1. Which type of crimes occurred most frequently in New York in year 2021?
2. How does crime rate changes by day?
3. How does crime rate changes by day of week?
4. How does crime rate changes by time of day?
5. How do crime patterns in boroughs based on timings of the crimes, days of the crimes, and types of crimes?
