It can be observed from the top graph that most of transit_district and housing_psa are missing, which can also be observed in the bottom right graph, where we can see that about 90% of data are missing both transit_district and housing_psa. Based on these massive missing cases, we can consider removing these two variables. It can also be observed that there are few cases where we are missing jurisdiction_code and pd_cd, and these two values are missing simultaneously. The jurisdiction code represents the jurisdiction responsible for the crime incident and pd_cd is the internal classification code. The reason for this phenomenon may be that pd_cd is a code relying on jurisdiction code. The other internal classification code ky_cd which is less granular than pd_cd has no missing values, so it is likely that pd_cd takes jurisdiction in to account when classifying while ky_cd does not.
