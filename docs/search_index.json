Thus, to maintain a safe environment in the city is the most crucial task facing the government and institutions. In order to control the crimes, it should take as the priority to understand the distribution of crimes in NYC and identity the factors that would be associated with crime rate. In this project, our group have thoroughly analyzed the NYPD Complaint Data provided by New York City Police Department (NYPD). The objective is to help people identity and visualize crime occurrences in the New York City. We have used various exploratory data analysis methods to answer the questions below: Which type of crimes occurred most frequently in New York in year 2021? How does crime rate changes by time (month, time of the day...)? How does crime rate changes by location? Are there any correlation between crime types and time or crime types and location? Our final goal for this project is not only to help people living in New York City to identity and reduce the risk to encounter crimes, but also help NYPD and national institutions to deploy and allocate resources and capital in highly dangerous areas to control crimes. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Yujie is responsible for looking for and collecting the data. Our dataset in this project was collected from NYC Open Data, which provides free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners. The Report Date of the data we used represents the date the incident was actually reported to the NYPD. Latitude and Longitude Coordinates are provided in Global Coordinate System WGS 1984 decimal degrees. These data represent criminal offenses according to New York State Penal Law definitions. Moreover, our group downloaded NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date) dataset provided by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), containing the data for all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to NYPD for all complete quarters so far this year (2021), so the information is accurate and authoritative. Therefore, we chose to use this dataset. Crime data for city of NYC available from NYC Open Data at: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 There are total of 324k rows and 36 columns in this dataset. The 36 variables ranges from exact locations of the occurrences to exact time of the occurrences. Details for key attributes are listed below: BORO_NM - The name of the borough in which the incident occurred CMPLNT_FR_DT - Exact date of occurrence for the reported event CMPLNT_FR_TM - Exact time of occurrence for the reported event OFNS_DESC - Description of offense corresponding with key code LONGITUDE - longitude of the crime case LATITUDE - latitude of the crime case As we checked the data types, we found the there are only 3 types of the variables: character, number, and integer. In order to better analyze the crimes, we converted the character type of data time to date type. To make offense types more readable and understandable, we categorized the OFNS_DESC to more generalized level so that our graphs would provide a better visualization. In our project, since we are analyzing the most recent crimes in New York, we subset data into more manageable smaller dataset with observations started from Jan 1, 2021 instead of the complete dataset. Data for November and December are missing since they have not been published. Data for October is partial by the same reason. So in some plots we may only include the first 9 months Another problem with the dataset is there are a number of missing values for part of the variables, this would be discussed in more details in section 4. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation NYC Open Data provides variety of formats of dataset.

We convert CMPLNT_FR_DT from character data to dates using as.date() to enable easier filter and management of the data. We want to show the number of crimes in each of the categories in NYC. OFNS_DESC is a column with description of offense corresponding with key code. OFNS_DESC contains 60 crime types. We combine two or more similar categories into one to reduce the the number of crime types to make the analysis more manageable. In order to look at how crimes are distributed with respect to time of day, day of week, and month, we create two columns day and month to show day of week and month of year respectively based on dates. CMPLNT_FR_TM is a column of exact time of occurrence for the reported event. We convert CMPLNT_FR_TM from character data to ITime using as.ITime(). We mutate a new column Time to show the time of day. If a crime occurs between time X:00 to time X:59, it shows &quot;X&quot; in the column. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing pattern Plot for NYC crime data, both count and percentage plots: In the missing pattern plot, there are only two missing patterns: 1, missing Borough 2, missing Crime Category We can see that most of the cases are complete in this dataset, so all rows have missing values. It can be observed from the top graph that 800 rows are missing Borough, and very few rous are missing Crime Category. However given the vast amount of crimes we can see that they are barely visible in the percentage plot Also from the right part of the graph, almost 100% of rows are complete cases which have no missing values. Since there are too few missing cases for Category, there is no need to analyse pattern for it. Since there are still a few hundred cases with missing Borough, we can do some analysis on them By the count plot, we can see that the major crime types missing borough are theft and homicide. By the percentage plot, We can see that over 90% of Homicide Crimes are missing borough information. This might because of the transportation of body, or that no borough wants to be record these vicious incidents so they just left it blank. So when doing analysis, we should avoid discussing the correlation between homicide and borough since most cases are missing this piece of information. For other categories, given such small percentage of missing cases, we can just ignore the missing cases and do analysis as usual. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overview 5.2 Crime Cases and Time 5.3 Crime Cases and Location 5.4 Correlations", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overview Theft, harassment, assault and criminal mischief occurs much more frequently in NYC. 5.2 Crime Cases and Time It can been seen most crime peaks occurred in the beginning of a month and the middle of a month. Crime incidents happened more frequently in summer month. Histograms shows that there indeed exists a pattern in the occurrence of crime with respect to the dimension of time. Summer months have higher occurrence of crime incidents with respect to other corresponding time periods. The latter parts of the day have higher occurrence of crime incidents. There is a peak of crime at hour 16, indicating more incidents take place during the periods 4:00pm - 4:59pm. There are less incidents in the morning periods (1am - 7am). In particular, very few crime incidents happen during the period of 5am. 5.3 Crime Cases and Location Brooklyn has highest number of crime, and Staten Island has lowest. A New York City map by plotting each individual crime cases. A heat map for all the crime cases. It can be seen that many regions in Brooklyn and Manhattan have very high crime counts. 5.4 Correlations From the parallel coordinates plot, we can observe that the pattern of Brooklyn and Queens are very similar, so they may form a cluster by the distribution of crime categories. Also, there seems to be a positive correlation between trepass and theft crimes, trepass and frauds. Police may need to find out the reason for such correlation. The first heat map shows the relationship between crime type and time of day, that is how different crimes vary by different times of the day. It can be found the crime type of theft crimes is the most common crime type with more than 4000 incidents per hours during the period of peak hours from 12pm to 18pm. Harassment(more prevalent in the afternoon), criminal mischief, and assault(more prevalent in the evening and at night) are also common during the day in NYC. The second heat map shows the relationship between crime type and borough.Theft crimes, the most common incident, happens frequently in all borough, but most frequently in Manhattan with more than 30000 incidents. It can also be observed that harassment, criminal mischief, and assault are the common types of crime across boroughs, and they happens most frequently in Brooklyn. The third heat map shows the relationship between borough and time of day. It turns out that Brooklyn is the most dangerous borough and there are more than 3000 incidents per hour during periods of 12pm-12:59pm and 4pm-6:59pm. In addition, Manhattan also has high number of crime incidents during 12pm-6:59pm. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component To get a more accurate sense of distribution of crime types over different boroughs, and to compare such distribution over different boroughs, this interactive barchart is created. The x axis represents the total number of crime cases in 2021 and y axis represents the category. If you want figures on the bars click show figure, otherwise click hide figure. Note that please first choose if you want figure or not, then choose the borough, otherwise you may forget which borough you have just chosen. The default plot is for Brooklyn. From test.html, you can see that I read data from a cleaned version in my own repo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ted5834314/NYC_Data/main/crimetype.csv Which is simply the crime counts for different categories in different boroughs. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Working on this project, we have applied different data exploratory methods learned in class and from other sources online: heatmaps, line plots, bar plots, etc. It is very important to select the right visualization tool according to different nature of data and effects we want provided to readers. For example, when we intended to see how crime rate fluctuated under the changes of two independent variables, we will use heatmaps to show the results. Some findings we obtained from this project: Summer time, beginning of each month, Friday, and afternoon are the time with higher risk of crime occurrence. It is not not hard to find the time slots are the time people are being more likely to stay outside. Thus, people should pay attention when there are denser population accumulated. There are relatively higher number of crimes conducted in Brooklyn. Theft crimes are the most common crime types during 12:00pm to 18:00pm; harassment, criminal mischief, and assault are the common types of crime during afternnons and evenings in te city. For other key deliverables, please refer to the results secction above. The police may choose to adjust their concentrations according to the results discussed in section 5. One limitation of this project is that the data doesn't include November and December, which hasn't been published yet, so we are missing some pattern. Also, this project is limited to discussing location, time and crime category. In the future, we may add more factors into consideration. In addition to time and location, we may consider other factors such as gender, age, etc. And do a deeper multi-correlation analysis between these factors. One thing we learned from this project is transforming the original dataset to a reasonable format to do analysis can be frustrating, given that we have to re-classify the crime categories to reach more general results.
